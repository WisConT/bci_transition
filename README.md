Quick Start 
------------

First, get python if you don't already have it. An easy way to get python installed is to use anaconda (works across platforms):

- https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

Second, git clone this repository and set up a virtual environment inside the folder installing all dependencies: 

1. pip install virtualenv (if you don't have it already installed)
2. Go inside this folder (e.g. cd bci_transition)
3. Create venv (e.g. virtualenv venv_bci) 
4. Activate the newly created virtual environment (e.g. source venv_bci/bin/activate)
5. Install all dependencies in requirements.txt (e.g. pip install -r requirements.txt)

(see more at https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/#virtualenvironments-ref )

Open Jupyter Lab to start working (type jupyter lab)
